bio: >
  Dennis has worked with Celeste to create a number of videos on topics ranging from Early Voting to a new series promoting local businesses in the 3rd Ward. It is so much fun to have such a creative, capable videographer working with us to communicate with the people of South Utica.


  Dennis moved to **South Utica** with his wife and children in 1987. He is a retired teacher (secondary English), pastor (Stone Church, Clinton) and international storyteller. He has been using his videography skills in retirement to spotlight Utica businesses and help with this campaign.
