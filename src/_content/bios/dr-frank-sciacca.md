name: Dr. Frank Sciacca
bio: >
  Frank is our Treasurer, filing all the required financial reports with the
  State of New York. (And I have to say, this is one of my favorite pictures of
  Frank.) With our grassroots campaign, he tracks all donations, and later this
  election season, will permit us to seek endorsement from Trailblazers PAC.
  “Trailblazers give voters the power to take back their rightful role in our
  democratic republic by moving politics out of the back room and onto the front
  porch.”


  Dr. Sciacca earned a doctorate and master’s from Columbia University and joined the faculty of Hamilton College in 1984. He is the Christian A. Johnson Excellence in Teaching Associate Professor of German & Russian Languages & Literatures (retired) and has lectured extensively on Russian Orthodox iconography and East Slavic folklore. In his retirement, Frank is the consummate world traveler!


  We are so happy that Frank has agreed to continue to volunteer as the Treasurer for our campaign.
