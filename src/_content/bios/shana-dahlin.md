bio: >
  To paraphrase Coleridge “Volunteers, volunteers everywhere… nor any drop to drink!” But Shana stands out among our volunteers! Shana writes “I am a proud member of the “purple posse.” She has worn so many hats as a campaign volunteer: photographer, cook, canvasser, and, most recently, tech consultant. Shana shares Celeste’s vision of a more vibrant, progressive Utica and is looking forward to another campaign season!
