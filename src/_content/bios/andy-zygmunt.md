bio: >
  Andy Zygmunt is our Campaign Manager. Andy works at least as hard as Celeste
  does, and is deeply invested in creating a better political culture in Utica.
  Andy came to Utica in 1992 to take a position as a research scientist at
  Masonic Research Laboratory, a position from which he retired in 2011. When he
  isn't running campaigns, or taking care of cats Edwards and James, Andy enjoys
  bike touring. He has biked all the way across the country twice!
