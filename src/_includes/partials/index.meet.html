            Since being sworn into office on January 1, 2020, I have worked hard to bring transparent, accessible, and responsive representation to the people of Utica’s Third Ward.

          <p class="my-4">Celeste has always enjoyed all her various roles and the challenges of learning new things: being a Philosopher, teaching college, forging jewelry and marketing it to people, directing a large, multi-faceted Festival. But maybe being a Public Servant is what she has loved the most. She hopes that the people of South Utica feel well-served by her efforts and will re-elect her in 2021.</p>
