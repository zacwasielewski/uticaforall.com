      I believe that democracy is stronger when we know more and participate more. And when we build that better, stronger democracy together, we create a higher quality of life for all of us who live here in Utica.

          <p class="my-4 max-w-2xl">I run big, active, people-powered campaigns with dozens of Volunteers who talk to hundreds and hundreds of people. Why? Because I believe that we ought to run a campaign that reflects how I intend to govern. I believe in, and I want, the kind of democracy where we are all engaged, where everyone’s voices are heard, where we all get to be part of the decisions about how to create the city we want to live in.</p>
