          <p class="my-4 max-w-2xl">My commitment to the goals of robust democracy have brought me into regular contact with my Constituents. I have resolved dozens upon dozens of Constituents’ issues, from the need for new stop signs to help get problem trees cut down. I have consistently brought to the Council’s attention the need to be accountable and transparent to the voters of Utica.</p>
            
          <p class="my-4 max-w-2xl">I am excited to be running for reelection in 2021. I need your support in order to continue fighting to make Utica a place where everyone can thrive and be heard and know that they are represented in our democracy. Please join me!</p>
