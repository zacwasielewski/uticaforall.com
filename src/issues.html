    <h3>Kept Transparency a Top Priority</h3>
    <p>Right from the start, Celeste made the Council more transparent and more accountable. She insisted that they
      keep and post minutes, for example. She continuously defends public comment, even during the Pandemic when 
      meetings were online. She also successfully argued for a strict version of the "Thursday Rule", so that Council
      members have time to study legislation before voting on it. She always insists that open meeting laws are
      followed, and works to keep all public business in front of the public, where it belongs. Now that the pandemic is over, she will continue to encourage people to come to Council meetings and use public comment.</p>
      
    <h3>Worked Hard to Address Flooding Problems</h3>
    <p>Since before even being sworn in, Celeste has worked to make sure that flooding remains a top priority in City
      Hall. She educated herself on how surface water works and why flooding happens. She regularly attends the
      Sauquoit Creek Basin Intermunicipal Commission. She has held three flooding meetings, and will be scheduling
      more for this Fall. She has developed good working relationships with both the DPW and Engineering Department
      in order to be able to both understand why flooding happens and how to prevent it. She is planning a meeting in
      September to update local residents on multiple efforts to mitigate for flooding.</p>
    
    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>Celeste communicates with constituents all the time, and in multiple ways. She gives out her personal phone
      number and picks up the phone whenever she can. She responds to emails, text messages, and Facebook
      messages. She posts regularly on Facebook and Twitter. AND she has sent out dozens and dozens of email
      Newsletters in the last year and a half, keeping anyone who signs up for them informed of Council and City
      business. She has also produced at least a dozen short videos (found on Facebook and YouTube) that promote
      South Utica and explain How Utica Works. Celeste fundamentally believes that transparency requires that elected
      officials communicate ALL THE TIME with the people they represent. She has several ideas for more "How Utica
      Works" newsletters, so stay tuned.</p>
      
    <h3>Helped to Maintain Livable Neighborhoods</h3>
    <p>Celeste goes to every ZBA meeting relevant to South Utica and advocates for neighbors. She has helped
      Constituents dealing with a wide variety of quality of life issues, from the need for "no parking" legislation and new stop signs, to writing legislation to deal with garbage and scrap metal. Celeste knows that quality of life in neighborhoods often comes down to enforcing our Codes, and she works hard with City Hall to ensure that this happens. She organized volunteers to help clean up neighborhoods for the Great American Cleanup. She even
      started a walking group that meets every Sunday and walks up into Roscoe Conkling Park. She is working hard to
      make sure that the gem of Roscoe Conkling Park is improved to provide more accessibility and enjoyment for
      everyone in Utica.</p>
    
    <h3>Economic Development in South Utica</h3>
    <p>Celeste has done a lot to promote South Utica businesses. She makes videos to promote local, independent
      businesses, as well as the arts. Celeste knows that there is a strong connection between economic development
      and supporting the arts. She will continue to work with the Uptown Theater to get them the funding they need,
      and will work with local business owners to begin an Uptown Business Association.</p>
