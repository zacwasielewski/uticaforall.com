    <h2 class="font-sans text-5xl font-bold my-8" id="absentee-voting">Absentee Voting</h2>

    <p>In New York State, you can also vote by absentee ballot. To do so, you must request an absentee ballot by October 18th from the Board of Elections: call 315-798-5765.</p>

    <p class="italic">From the BoE website:</p>

    <h3 class="font-bold mb-4">Qualifications to Vote by Absentee Ballot</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 lg:pl-0">
      <li>Absent from your county or, if a resident of New York City absent from said city, on Election Day.</li>
      <li>Unable to appear at the polls due to temporary or permanent illness or disability; or because you are the primary care giver of one or more individuals who are ill or physically disabled.</li>
      <li>A patient or inmate in a Veterans’ Administration Hospital</li>
      <li>Detained in jail awaiting Grand Jury action or confined in prison after conviction for an offense other than a felony.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="font-bold mb-4">How to Apply for an Absentee Ballot</h3>
    
    <p>Applications for Absentee Ballots are available from the Oneida County Board of Elections by calling 315-798-5765. You may also download a PDF version of the <a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingAbsentee.html" class="link">Absentee Ballot Application</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Upon completion, applications must be mailed to <i class="italic">Oneida County Board of Elections, Union Station, 321 Main Street 3rd Floor, Utica, NY 13501</i> no later than the seventh day before the election or delivered in person no later than 9:00 PM the day of the election.</p>
    
    <p>Voters can still request an absentee ballot due to the pandemic. When completing the absentee ballot application, voters should select “temporary illness or physical disability” as their reason for requesting the application.</p>
    
    <p>Absentee ballot boxes will be at each poll site on Election Day, at each of the 3 early voting sites  throughout the early voting period, and at the BOE. Voters within Oneida County can drop their absentee ballots off at any of these sites.</p>
